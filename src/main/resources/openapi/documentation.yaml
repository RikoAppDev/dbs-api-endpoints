I make sure the wires are in securely and that the lights suggest there's an actual internet connection. Usually after that point I just reset the router( and possibly the cable modem) and that fixes things most of the time.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is I'd like to know what sort of issue I could possibly be fixing by resetting the router.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Just to clarify, I was speaking more about reset as in turning the router off and on. Still, any information about a hard reset(paperclip in the hole) is useful. So the more accurate term would probably be restarting </p>\n\n<p>Also, personally I usually have to deal with D-Link or Linksys home routers. I generally only bother messing around with stuff if I can't make a connection to the internet at all.</p>\n"
